            <h2 class="section-title">Overview</h2>
            <p>The Movie Recommendation System is a comprehensive Python application designed to provide users with personalized movie recommendations. It leverages state-of-the-art content-based filtering techniques to ensure that each recommendation aligns with the user's taste, offering a modern solution for discovering new movies. The application is built with a clean, dark-themed user interface using Tkinter, making it both visually appealing and easy to navigate.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Core Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Personalized Recommendations:</strong> The system utilizes collaborative filtering combined with TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to analyze and suggest movies that are similar to the one provided by the user. By analyzing the movie's overview, genres, keywords, cast, and crew, the algorithm generates a list of movies that share similar characteristics, ensuring the recommendations are both relevant and engaging.</li>
                <li><strong>Advanced Search Functionality:</strong> Users can easily input any movie title, and the system will instantly generate a list of similar movies. This feature allows users to explore films they might have otherwise missed, enhancing their movie-watching experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Interactive User Interface:</strong> The application’s interface is built with Tkinter and features a dark theme inspired by modern development environments like Visual Studio Code. This design choice not only makes the application aesthetically pleasing but also reduces eye strain, making it comfortable to use for extended periods.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="section-title">Technologies Used</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Python:</strong> The backbone of the application, Python was chosen for its versatility and powerful libraries, making it ideal for implementing the recommendation algorithm and managing the application logic.</li>
                <li><strong>Tkinter:</strong> This library was used to create the graphical user interface (GUI). Tkinter’s simplicity and flexibility allowed for the development of a responsive and polished interface, giving users an intuitive experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Pandas:</strong> Integral to the data processing pipeline, Pandas was used to manage and manipulate the datasets involved in generating recommendations. Its powerful data structures facilitated the merging, cleaning, and analyzing of movie data.</li>
                <li><strong>scikit-learn:</strong> The scikit-learn library was employed to implement collaborative filtering and the TF-IDF vectorizer. These machine learning tools were critical in calculating movie similarities and delivering accurate recommendations.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <h2 class="section-title">Challenges and Solutions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Integration:</strong> Merging multiple datasets (movies and credits) posed challenges, particularly in ensuring data consistency and handling missing values. These issues were resolved through careful preprocessing, including data cleaning and transformation techniques.</li>
                <li><strong>Optimization of Recommendation Engine:</strong> Ensuring that the recommendation engine was both accurate and efficient required fine-tuning the collaborative filtering and TF-IDF methods. By experimenting with different configurations and leveraging the power of scikit-learn, the final solution achieved a good balance between performance and recommendation quality.</li>
            </ul>
